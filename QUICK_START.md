# 🎯 Gemini API Integration - Quick Start Guide

## What was implemented

The hybrid routing system now fully supports Google Gemini API for answering general knowledge questions, while book/literature questions are still routed to the fine-tuned SLM model.

## Key Features ✨

- **Smart Routing**: Automatically detects book vs. general questions
- **Gemini Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini API for general knowledge
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Works even without API key (with placeholder responses)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API failures
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup with environment variables or parameters

## Quick Setup 🚀

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Get Gemini API key**:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create an API key
   - Copy it

3. **Set API key**:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

4. **Run the system**:
   ```bash
   python examples/hybrid_routing.py
   ```

## Usage Examples 💡

### Basic Usage
```python
from examples.hybrid_routing import HybridQARouter

# Initialize with API key
router = HybridQARouter(gemini_api_key="your_key")

# Ask questions - automatic routing!
result = router.route_and_answer("What is the capital of France?")
print(result['answer'])  # Answered by Gemini

result = router.route_and_answer("Who wrote The Great Gatsby?")
print(result['answer'])  # Answered by SLM (when loaded)
```

### Environment Variable Setup
```python
# Set environment variable first:
# export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"

router = HybridQARouter()  # Automatically reads env var
result = router.route_and_answer("How does photosynthesis work?")
```

## How Routing Works 🧠

The system automatically decides which model to use:

### 📚 Books/Literature (→ SLM)
- Questions about authors, books, characters
- Examples: "Who wrote 1984?", "What genre is Pride and Prejudice?"

### 🌍 General Knowledge (→ Gemini)
- Science, geography, math, current events
- Examples: "What is the capital of France?", "How does photosynthesis work?"

## Testing 🧪

Run the comprehensive test:
```bash
python test_integration_simple.py
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing Gemini API Integration Structure
==================================================
...
🎉 All tests passed! Gemini integration is ready.
```

## Demos Available 🎬

1. **Basic Demo**: `python examples/hybrid_routing.py`
2. **Feature Demo**: `python examples/gemini_demo.py`
3. **Integration Test**: `python test_integration_simple.py`

## Example Output 📊

```
Question: What is the capital of France?
Model: LLM (Google Gemini)
Routing: general_knowledge
Answer: The capital of France is Paris.

Question: Who wrote The Great Gatsby?
Model: SLM (Fine-tuned T5-small)
Routing: domain_specific
Answer: F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby.
```

## Files Modified/Added 📁

- ✅ `examples/hybrid_routing.py` - Main implementation
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Added google-generativeai
- ✅ `GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `examples/gemini_demo.py` - Demo script
- ✅ `test_integration_simple.py` - Integration tests

## What happens without API key 🔄

The system gracefully falls back to placeholder responses:
```
Answer: [LLM Response] I would need to integrate with a large language model API to answer: 'What is the capital of France?'
```

## Production Ready ✅

- Error handling for API failures
- Timeout protection
- Mock key detection
- Comprehensive logging
- Fallback mechanisms

## Next Steps 🚀

1. Get your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. Set the environment variable: `export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"`
3. Run: `python examples/hybrid_routing.py`
4. Start asking questions!

The integration is complete and ready for production use! 🎉
